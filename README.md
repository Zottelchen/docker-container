# Docker Containers

These images mostly exist for my personal use, but others are free to use it.

I am constantly looking for improving these images, so if you have any suggestions, please open an issue.

The core principles of these images are:

1. Try to cover as many platforms as possible
2. Be as small & secure as possible
3. Be available on Docker Hub & GitHub Container Registry (and maybe later on Quay.io)
